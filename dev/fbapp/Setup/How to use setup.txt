3. Follow the instructions in the docx file.
4. Don't edit index.php and main.php as written in the Setup.docx file edit config.php instead.
5. Done!


it seems I found why this app constantly redirects to "index.php"
the problem is in this code:
Code:
<script>top.location="index.php"</script>
It endlessly opens "index.php" but it should do this only one time to break the fb iframe.
try this code instead:
Code:
<script type="text/javascript">
  if (top.location.href != self.location.href)
     top.location.href = self.location.href;
</script>
it breaks from the fb iframe, I hope this will work

another solution: if you want it to redirect to "main.php" if the page is liked change this:
Code:
<script>top.location="index.php"</script>
to this:
Code:
<script>top.location="main.php"</script>
